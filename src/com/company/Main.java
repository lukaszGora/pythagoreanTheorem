/*
In high-school geometry, you learned the Pythagorean theorem for the relationship
of the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle:
a2 + b2 = c2
Most of this expression contains simple operators covered in Chapter 3. The one
piece thatâ€™s missing is taking square roots, which you can do by calling the standard
function Math.sqrt. For example, the statement
double y = Math.sqrt(x);
sets y to the square root of x.
Write a ConsoleProgram that accepts values for a and b as doubles (you can
assume that a and b will be positive) and then calculates the solution of c as a
double.
